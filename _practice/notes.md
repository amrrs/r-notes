Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
Leo Tolstoy
and every messy data is messy in its own way – it’s easy to define the characteristics of a clean
dataset  (rows  are  observations,  columns  are  variables,  columns  contain  values  of  consistent
types). If you start to look at real life data you’ll see every way you can imagine data being messy
(and many that you can’t)!
